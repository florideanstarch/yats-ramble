scrolling through linkedin came across the profile of someone who we did **not** accept in the company...they have a master's and a phd from EU plus some higher up referred them 

now, who took that decision? few people who did not see "spark" in this candidate's eyes and some others who thought their "plant sciences" background did not fit a bizdev profile. well maybe! but all of this just feels wrong, another human's labour just written off as not good enough...but ig that is how you run a business, no emotions. and in sometime we might have agents doing all of this anyway (even if we do not, being sad about this someone is not worth it) 

another thing that irked me, from a conversation during the day...this is so performative man, you need to repeatedly perform being good enough. work and let the bloody work talk, just the public display of climbing ladders every millisec is super weird...to me, at least but then meh...that is how it is!

ah! i really need to wrap up these fastai videos man, jeremy is cool (also need to start taking notes and read the book along). jon krohn is also something that I have left in the middle...ughhh!

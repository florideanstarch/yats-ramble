this began probably last year, when Deepak introduced me to a tiny Tamil hamlet and a former Danish fort - Tranquebar (or as it is now called _Tharangambadi_)

i saw few blogs, the place felt like a time machine. the fort was of a size of a sarkari [bangla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungalow) and the houses felt like a Malgudi day episode (i'm a big hoe for old school Tamil houses). [one](https://travelshoebum.com/2017/11/15/danish-delight-in-india-tranquebar-tharangambadi/) of the blogs had a warning, where the traveler ended up in Karaikal due to a miscommunication.

armed with all this information, we did not set out for a journey. we went on about our lives.

in early june, i was back in hyderabad. recovering from a back injury. in august, we had a bunch of long weekends and thanks to [Varalakshmi Vratam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varalakshmi_Vratam) we decided to see the fort.

## 12604

the showers made it tough for us to reach the station, but we did make it thanks to Hyderabad Metro and a good cabbie. the newly minted [Charlapalli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlapalli_railway_station) station felt something close to a small village airport in Finland.

our coach was not an LHB coach, the fellow travelers included some Telugu folk and perhaps some were like us, [corpos](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate#:~:text=Corporates) and some were not.

our irctc e-catering order got cancelled once and we had to reorder, were supposed to collect to it at [Nellore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellore). 

while we waited we stood by the train doors, looking at the moon and red Guntur chilli farms (that is what we think it was at least from google maps) on our way to Chennai


## Chennai

the fiery biryani in Nellore had meant a good night's sleep, we rose at dawn and 12604 was now at [MAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Central_railway_station). 

my broken phone need a charge as the duplicate screen that I had installed just before the journey was draining the battery even when the phone was shut. we could see some birds and the [JLN stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_Stadium,_Chennai) from the station. 

the battery had enough charge now to get the phone to breathe, that is when we decided to make a move. with some bags in the cloak room it was time to make a move.

Vignesh had recommended Mylapore as place to visit, the [Kapaleeshwarar Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapaleeshwarar_Temple) and the Marina beach. we decided to get down at [Teyanampet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teynampet) and took an auto to Mylapore. the auto driver warned us that we would need to pay more than what the app had showed. this was a bit odd, we could not figure out as to whether this was due to us not knowning the language or was it a Chennai thing (later Vignesh would let us know that it is a norm in the city). we were in dire need of coffee and had a coffee kadai as our destination.

as the luck would have it, where the auto had left us, there was some [CMRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Metro_Rail_Limited) construction work going on. we meandered some and then realized that the construction meant we needed to go find another coffee kadai. through the wide streets of Mylapore and past some huge houses inhabited by former govt. employees and one old cardiologist, we reached a Madras Coffee House on the Luz church road that we had spotted while in auto. the coffee was sweet and the samosa was...well different.

we then started looking at some cafes, [The Mayflower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g7AkzX6BFMJWdKA27) is something which caught our attention. the sun was out now, but the weather was still pleasant. walking past another series of upper-middle class houses and a beautiful kerala resto, we reached the The Mayflower only to find out that it had a huge sack of supplies in front of the entrance and they still had not opened up for the day.

on our way, luckily there was another cafe with a brick coloured building. this was [Bask by Coffee?](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SWREYsc4H144H6Py7). it had a curious "Saleem's Since 1977" board outside, which we later found out was referring to the famous Saleem's of Delhi (that's the eatery owned by [Huma "Saleem" Qureshi's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_Qureshi) family).

the meeting never happened, we worked on a blog, enjoyed the coffee and bagel there. the crowd comprised of a small group of hindi-speaking folks, gentle north-eastern staff and mainly chennaivaasis.

next stop was going to be the Kapaleeshwarar Temple, but it was only after sitting in the auto and consulting with Vignesh we realized that the diety would be resting for the afternoon. nonetheless, we got down near the temple and again we were asked to pay Rs. 20 more than what the app had suggested. 

we found a man trying to rent out a scooty for the day and reminding us that the temple was closed. after refusing, we set out towards was serene alleys beside the temple. the temple pond was as big as the temple, a beautiful sight. gopuram had us excited too, although it felt POP-ed in recent repairs. walking through the streets we saw a calm lane along the _Kutchery_ road, near the [Mylapore Police Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zhf8rZfRmUvkwzXR7). the tiny houses besides the temple are worth mentioning, traditional gable-roofs with clay tiles, a great sight!

we then traced our steps back, to find a filter coffee spot. unfortuneately, every spot that people had been recommended to us was closed. a restaurants the corner grabbed our attention, it was luckily open. we had reached Mylapore's [Ratna Cafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratna_Cafe). Vignesh had mentioned that they are famous for sambar. we later learnt the cafe was run by a family from north, originally from Mathura, UP, that probably explained the scrumptious samosas at the entrance of the restaurant. we decided to hog on "meals" (this is what the people in north would call a _thali_). we got unilimited amount of poriyal, kesari, rice, potato chips, tayir, rasam, and sambar. 

we had by then, decided to go to [Higginbotham's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higginbotham%27s). this is India's oldest bookstore in existence. read up on its interesting story! we had a young auto driver pick us up, playing a mix Ilaiyaraaja and western songs, swiftly taking us through lanes of Mylapore and past the [Vivekanada College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramakrishna_Mission_Vivekananda_College).

having spent some time going through books and unsuccessfuly looking for Tamarind City by [Bishwanath Ghosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishwanath_Ghosh_(writer)), we decided to catch the metro from the LIC metro station (right opposite the LIC office housed in builiding, which at some point in time was the [tallest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIC_Building) in the country). 

the metro ride to the railway station was unremarkable, we got our bags from the cloakroom and headed back for the CMBT [stand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Mofussil_Bus_Terminus). while we were supposed to get down, there was confusion which was resolved by a fellow traveller, for the bus terminal one should get down at CMBT not Koyambedu (that's for the market). at CMBT, we stood for the bus to Pondicherry. there were a few buses with ECR and புதுச்சேரி written on them. when we prompted the group of drivers and bus conductors in English for details about the bus, we were told (or what we understood) that one of the buses that stood will depart for Pondicherry around 7:00 pm. well that was not the case, there was a bus that departed at that time, but not the one that we thought would. rather a bus came and people flocked towards it, queueing up before we realized that it was a bus which would go to Pondicherry. we could not find a seat in that bus. this was a classic case of miscommunication. by the time another bus came, we had the tamil letters for "P" and "Y" memorised and had spent some time despartely looking for BlaBlaCars. this time, we were able to squeeze through the sea of people trying to board. a tore my t-shirt but we did make it. 

the journey to Pondicherry started slow, we were sweating as the bus was ploughing through Chennai traffic while picking up passengers. it took us more than one hour to reach the Guindy and IIT Madras. once we were on ECR, the journey was relatively smooth. we had downloaded the Tamarind City e-book, read up on how the city of Chennai came into being and what as bemusing was how random the origin of the city was! had that one bullet gone through, Clive wouldn't have lived and maybe the course of history would have been differently and Chennai would not be Chennai. 

the bus was now flying through dimness of the night on ECR, some passengers had to sit on the floor of the bus. we could not get a sight of [MAPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Atomic_Power_Station) in the night. we slept for sometime, the bus had then stopped for tea, we got down and had some. in a matter of an hour, we were in now in Kalapet.
